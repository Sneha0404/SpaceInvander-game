# SpaceInvaderwithGestures
A project to make a game which is gesture controlled using opencv library of Python.

The initial idea was to make the game playable only through kyboard. But soon it was clear that it was a tedious as well as a hard job to do. So I decided to make the game in such a way that one can move the character through hand gestures and require the keyboard only to shoot the bullets. This will make it easy for the new playrs to play the game.

I made 2 programs to see if it is working or not. They are main.py and gesture.py.
